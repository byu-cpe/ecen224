## Objectives

- Become familiar with the data types included in stdint.h
- Become familiar with c-style strings
- Gain some practice with debugging

## Getting Started

Use the GitHub Classroom link posted in the Learning Suite for the lab to accept the assignment. Next, ssh into your Raspberry Pi using VSCode and clone the repository in your home directory. **This lab should be done in VSCode on your Raspberry Pi.**

## Overview



### Intentional and Incremental Programming
Intentional and incremental programming are two important mindsets to have while diving into software development. Intentional programming is a mindset that prioritizes writing code that is **clear, concise, and easy to understand**. In other words, the emphasis is on writing code that accurately reflects the your intentions rather than trying whatever and seeing if it sticks. Approaching a solution in code intentionally will inevitably be a lot more productive and easier to maintain and extend in the future. 

Incremental programming, on the other hand, involves **dividing the solution you are trying to create into small, manageable chunks** that can be developed and tested individually. This allows for a more flexible, iterative approach to software development. This means that changes can be made easily and quickly, without having to completely overhaul the entire solution when something crashes. 

Handling large amounts of data in C is no small task (as you will see in the next lab). It requires attention to detail and a good understanding of the code you are writing and what it does. As the projects in this and other programming-centric classes become more complex and involved, it is important to remember that **the best line of defense against buggy code is a good offense: intentional and incremental programming.**

### Trace debugging


## Submission

- Complete all the activities and answer the questions in the `README.md`.

- To successfully submit your lab, you will need to follow the instructions in the [Lab Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/lab-setup) page, especially the **Committing and Pushing Files** section.

- To pass off to a TA, show the output of your debugged program using the logging library.
